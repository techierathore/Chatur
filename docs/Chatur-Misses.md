# Chatur — Misses

|---|---|
| App | Chatur |
| Count | 0 logged: 0 open, 0 fixed, 0 will not fix |
| Source | `docs/metrics/misses.jsonl`, one row per miss record. Rewritten by `tf-misses-md.sh` on every new record. Never edit it: a wrong row is corrected by a new record. |

**Whose gap** answers the four questions of the miss protocol: **the app's spec** did not say it, so the checklist line is fixed; **the framework never said it**, so one requirement line and a check are added; **the check was too weak** (a review, or a script that did not fire), so the check is fixed; **said and ignored**, so the rule becomes a hook or is deleted. **not sorted** means the record predates the sort or nobody has answered yet; `bash .tfcore/utils/tf-emit.sh --amend <miss> sort <spec|unsaid|weak-check|ignored>` completes it.

No miss has been logged yet.
